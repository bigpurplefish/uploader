## Git Workflow Preferences

**Commit Strategy:** Proactive (Option 2)

### How It Works

When making changes to a project:
1. ‚úÖ Make the code changes and test them
2. ‚úÖ After completing a significant feature or set of changes, **ASK THE USER**: "Would you like me to commit and push these changes to GitHub?"
3. ‚è∏Ô∏è Wait for user approval before committing
4. ‚úÖ If approved, create a meaningful commit with:
   - Descriptive commit message explaining what was changed and why
   - Group related changes together (don't commit every tiny change separately)
   - Include "ü§ñ Generated with Claude Code" footer
   - Include "Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>" line
5. ‚úÖ Push to the configured GitHub remote

### What Counts as "Significant"

**DO ask about committing:**
- ‚úÖ New feature added
- ‚úÖ Bug fix completed
- ‚úÖ Documentation updates (major changes)
- ‚úÖ Refactoring completed
- ‚úÖ Multiple related changes that form a cohesive update
- ‚úÖ Configuration changes (when user approves)
- ‚úÖ Dependency updates

**DO NOT auto-commit:**
- ‚ùå Work in progress
- ‚ùå Experimental changes
- ‚ùå Small typo fixes (unless user specifically requests)
- ‚ùå Incomplete features
- ‚ùå Failed tests or broken code
