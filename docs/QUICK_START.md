## Important Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **All image URLs must be Shopify CDN URLs**

‚ö†Ô∏è **Processing takes time**
   - Multiple API calls per product

## If Processing Is Interrupted

4. Script automatically resumes from last processed product
5. No duplicates are created

## Troubleshooting

- Check: `pip install ttkbootstrap requests`

**Validation fails?**
- Verify all file paths exist
- Check credentials in Settings

**URL validation error?**
- All images must be on Shopify CDN
